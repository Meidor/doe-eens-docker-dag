# cgroups

_&ldquo; A cgroup limits an application to a specific set of hardware resources.&rdquo;_ **&mdash; [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/)**

<!-- note
* cgroups provide hardware resource isolation
* a cgroup limits an application to a specific set of resources.
* cgroups allow Docker Engine to:
  * share available hardware resources
  * optionally enforce limits and constraints
